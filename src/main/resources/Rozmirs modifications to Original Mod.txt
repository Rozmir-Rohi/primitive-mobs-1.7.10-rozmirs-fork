Sheepman Smith now accepts Thaumcraft Gold Coins or anything else in the "nuggetGold" ore dictionary for item repairs.

Lost Miners now become Villagers once they reach the surface and reward the player.

Precious Pickaxes are now a 10% spawn chance inside haunted tool spawns (previously was a 1% chance). This new spawn chance is also the same chance as a silver sword drop from a Silver Skeleton in Mo' Creatures.



Slight clean up of code in EntitySheepmanSmith.

Slight clean up of brackets with CanDespawn function in most mobs.

Renamed mod and changed mcmod.info accordingly.



Added built-in Thaumcraft aspects.
