# Primitive Mobs Rozmirs Fork

This project is a modified version of the Primitive Mobs mod v1.0c for 1.7.10 and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0.


## Modifications to Original Mod
* Sheepman Smith now accepts Thaumcraft Gold Coins or anything else in the "nuggetGold" ore dictionary for item repairs.

* Lost Miners now become Villagers once they reach the surface and reward the player.

* Precious Pickaxes are now a 10% spawn chance inside haunted tool spawns (previously was a 1% chance). This new spawn chance is also the same chance as a silver sword drop from a Silver Skeleton in Mo' Creatures.


* Slight clean up of code in EntitySheepmanSmith.

* Slight clean up of brackets with CanDespawn function in most mobs.

* Renamed mod and changed mcmod.info accordingly.


* Added built-in Thaumcraft aspects.
